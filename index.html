    <h3>Downstacking</h3>

    <p>The most common and effective way to practice your downstacking efficiency is by playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220830153540/https://jstris.jezevec10.com/?play=3&amp;mode=3">cheese race</a> on Jstris. Try to play 100L, as lower block counts tend to be heavily affected by RNG. Additionally, look to finish the cheese race with as <strong>few blocks as possible, rather than as quickly as possible</strong>. The milestone for which you are "good" at downstacking for many players is to complete a 100L cheese race in under 300 blocks, but any PB is a good PB, so just keep up your practice! Cheese is very mentally taxing.</p>

    <p>(If 100L is too much for you, play 18L and aim for an <strong>average</strong> of sub 50 blocks for each run, but ideally you are playing 100L.)</p>

    <p>The basic things you should be worrying about when playing cheese are as follows: </p>

    <ol>

      <li>Don't cover your garbage holes.</li>
      <li>Look at all your preview pieces, and notice what dependencies will be formed not just on your current stack, but after holes have cleared.</li>
      <li>Keep your board clean.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>A common beginner mistake is to only focus on not covering your garbage holes, and disregarding the other 2 concepts. Make sure you're looking at your board and trying to keep everything clean!</p>

    <p>Another thing to note is that <strong>cheese is not VS downstacking</strong>. Don't look to extend your combos in cheese, they don't matter. However, in VS downstacking, sometimes getting down slower but sending some attacks (stacking up for a tetris, making a tspin, powerstacking a bit to combo) is the right option. Cheese is a visualization exercise that will help you see new patterns in garbage and improve your preview vision, which is especially important on the downstack.</p>

    <h3>APM</h3>

    <p>The most straightforward way to increase your APM is to better utilize your I and T pieces to send tetrises and T-spins (Back-to-back / B2B Clears). The usual mode we practice APM in is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220830153540/https://jstris.jezevec10.com/?play=5">Ultra</a> (score as high as you can in 2:00) on Jstris, because B2B pressure is heavily correlated with your score.</p>

    <p>In the beginning, you should be playing at a pace where you can think through all of your decisions, and aim for the highest points per block (ppb) you can. This ideally means you use all your t-pieces for tspins, and keep B2B by clearing only T-spins and tetrises. A good goal to aim for in the beginning is 250+ ppb, but the optimal amount is around 300.</p>

    <p><strong>Increasing your APM obviously ties into the section on T-spins below.</strong></p>

    <p>(Note that sending TOO much clean / b2b pressure can be a detriment, as your opponent can send your clean garbage back as tetrises very easily. Make sure to mix up your sends a bit!)</p>

    <p>(Why not blitz? The level system on blitz makes ppb inconsistent across different levels, and encourages you to stride through the early levels. Ultra is just simpler.)</p>

    <h3>Stacking</h3>

    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220830153540/https://jstris.jezevec10.com/usermodes/1699" target="_blank">The ETERNAL EXERCISE</a> (pinned in #coaching-text-channel):

    <p>
      Complete a 40L sprint with: <br>
      1) no holes in your stack. <br>
      2) clear ONLY tetrises. <br>
      3) keep your board low (below 1/2 height ideal but ok if a little above, above 3/4 height above restart) <br>
      This will force you to stack well and you won't be able to complete this exercise if you don't actively avoid/fix the patterns below:
    </p>
    <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220830153540im_/https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/728819154328485888/769204086033088572/unknown.png" alt="">

    <p>
      so when you're placing your pieces, you want to look at your stack and think <br>
      1) is there a bad shape that I can fix with my current piece? if so, fix it. <br>
      2) is there a place that I can put this piece that won't create a bad shape? if so, put it there. <br>
      If there's no way to put a piece without making a bad shape, don't panic. Just continue along and try to fix them as quickly as possible.
      It's inevitable for bad patterns toto pop up, but it's your job to bring your stack back to clean as quickly as possible!<br>
      It's a lot easier to fix a stack with one bad pattern rather than 3.

    <h3>VOD Review / Don't Know</h3>

    <p>Knowing what you need to work on can be hard! The first thing to do is take <strong>take a look through your own replays.</strong> If you've sent in your request for general review, you should've sent in a versus replay that you think is representative of your skill. Take a watch through that and try and spot where you make mistakes! Not only will this help your session along, but it'll also help you improve on your own without needing to wait on coaching or ask for help from others. Being critical of your own gameplay and isolating the skills that you're lacking is incredibly important if you want to get better at any skill.</p>

    <p>Here are some common mistakes to look for in your play:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Wasting I / T pieces in the stack</strong> Your I and T (if you're tspinning) pieces are your main source of damage. Damage is not only great for killing your opponent, but also for defending-- you can cancel your opponent's attack or force your opponent to tank / cancel your damage so you have time to come down. Especially look where you die a few lines away from your clean garbage-- did you waste an I piece you could've used? Did you miss a way you could set up tspin, and wasted T in the stack? </li>
      <li><strong>Covering your garbage holes</strong> Every piece you place over your garbage holes is a piece you will need to clear in the future. There are places where it's inevitable that you place pieces over your garbage hole, but take note in your replay where you do, and try and find a way you can avoid doing it. One common mistake is building a tspin overhang over your garbage hole-- try to see if you do this, and remember to put your overhang on the other side.</li>
      <li><strong>Doing nothing</strong> Note when you just start to skim lines and do nothing. Are you just kind of clearing lines at the top of your board instead of getting down? Are you just kind of clearing lines at the bottom of your board instead of building up attacks? Notice when you're just clearing singles, doubles, and triples instead of tetrises or tspins. Stacking a triple up to a tetris on your downstack is a good way to give yourself some cover as you come down.</li>
    </ol>
